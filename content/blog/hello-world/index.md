Hi everyone, you're on the first article of this blog, I launched on march 30th 2020.

Who am i ?

I'm Toum, I work as a mobile and front-end developer in Belgium. I'm also an 
amateur sysadmin (on my personal home server), a Linux fanboy and open source 
advocate. I love TypeScript and work mostly with React, so I think you can 
expect all sort of content around here.

Why now?

I'm starting this blog from my quarantined flat because I have no excuses not
to anymore. I've been talking about starting this blog for a long time and
always found something else to do instead. I'm also trying new thing to impove 
myself and I feel like writing could be a good start.

See you right here because I'm not going anywhere (quarantine, you know)
