Why now?

I'm starting this blog from my quarantined flat because I have no excuses not
to anymore. I've been talking about starting this blog for a long time and
always found something else to do instead.

What are we going to do here ?

Well, I don't know myself, what I do know is that I'm a passionate JavaScript
dev, but also an amateur sysadmin (on my personal home server), a Linux fanboy
and an anti-Gogole advocate. If you like those subjects you'll probably find a
some articles that you will like or will want to react to. I love a
good debate ;)

See you right here because I'm not going anywhere (quarantine, you know)
